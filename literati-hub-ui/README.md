# LiteratiHub - Frontend

## Overview

The front-end of the LiteratiHub project is designed to provide an intuitive and responsive user interface for interacting with the LiteratiHub backend. Built with Angular and styled using Tailwind CSS, this front-end application delivers a seamless experience for users to manage their book-related activities and account information.

## Technologies Used

- **Angular**: A powerful front-end framework for building single-page applications (SPAs).
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for creating custom designs directly in your markup.

## Setup Instructions

To set up the front-end of the LiteratiHub project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nathsagar96/literati-hub.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:

   ```bash
   cd literati-hub
   cd literati-hub-ui
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:

   Ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed. Then run:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Start the Development Server**:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   This will start the development server and open the application in your default web browser.

5. **Build for Production**:

   To create a production-ready build, run:

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

   The build files will be located in the `dist/` directory.

## Development

- **Angular CLI**: Use Angular CLI commands to generate components, services, and other Angular artifacts.
